## When Making Changes

- Check for similar functionality already in the codebase; prefer reuse over new patterns.
- Ensure changes work across dev, test, and prod orgs; avoid environment-specific assumptions.
- Update JSON configuration files (e.g., `data/configs/*.json`) instead of hardcoding logic.
- Test with multiple org configurations if available; consider namespace and record type differences.
- Validate security implications (FLS/object permissions); do not expose restricted fields.
- Update documentation (e.g., `docs/`, READMEs) when adding features or behaviors.
- Donâ€™t break features that are already unit/integration tested; consider cross-feature impact.
- Prefer minimal, incremental edits; remove dead/duplicate logic if introducing a new approach.
